# weather_app

The Simple Weather App is a simple Flutter application that displays the user's current city, temperature, weather, and relevant animations. 

# Learning Outcome

From this project, I revised how to:
- Use APIs to fetch weather data.
- Implement geolocation services with the Geolocator package.
- Write maintainable and clean code using improved coding practices.
